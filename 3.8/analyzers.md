# Text Processing with Analyzers

Configurable **Analyzers** are available for text processing, such as for
tokenization, language-specific word stemming, case conversion, removal of
diacritical marks (accents) from characters and more. Analyzers can be used
standalone or in combination with Views for sophisticated searching.
